# Dedication
#+begin_quote
üê∞ This project is created and maintained in loving memory of *Sparky*, aka *Chispitas*, aka *Chispis*, in the hope he will become immortal and, eventually, one with the Force. üê∞ @@html:<br>@@
/To the moon and back, forever ‚ù§/

*Defy the limits:* Blend your style and experience on a global, competitive stage. You have 13 rounds to attack and defend your side using sharp gunplay and tactical abilities. And, with one life per-round, you'll need to think faster than your opponent if you want to survive.

*Creativity is your greatest weapon:* More than guns and bullets, you‚Äôll choose a character armed with adaptive, swift, and lethal abilities that create opportunities to let your gunplay shine. No two characters play alike, just as no two highlight reels will look the same.

*Fight around the world:* Each map is a playground to showcase your creative thinking. Purpose-built for team strategies, spectacular plays, and clutch moments. Make the play others will imitate for years to come.

* Build from source

In order to build /Sparky/ from source, preparation is needed so as to the environment is properly setup and ready.

** Get the code

First, download the codebase of the project. It's important to do so via the *OFFICIAL* Git repository hosted on [[https://github.com/sparky-game/sparky][GitHub]], and not through any tarball or compressed archive to ensure no tampering is done with the code. Appart from that, any ref can be checked out, being ~master~ (the trunk of all dev progress), a tagged commit (e.g. ~v1.0~), an actively maintained version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/stable~) or a LTS version branch (e.g. ~v1.0.y/lts~) the preferred ones.

To clone the official repo as well as all its submodules, issue the following command:

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sparky-game/sparky
#+end_src

** Dependencies

These are the packages needed to be able to build /Sparky/ from source, they are divided by distribution/package manager. Also, a command for each one is added to make the installation of these development dependencies as easy and straightforward as possible.

- ~make~
- ~gcc~ / ~clang~
- ~rust~
- ~jq~
- ~libX11~
- ~libXcursor~
- ~libXrandr~
